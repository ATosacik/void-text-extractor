## About

VoidTextExtractor runs entirely locally in your browser, keeping your files private and secure.  
The project was carefully designed and implemented piece by piece, with a strong focus on reliability, usability, and visual polish. All features were thoroughly tested, including custom elements such as the interactive title.
The theme, structure, and overall user experience were thoughtfully crafted, with attention paid to both functionality and aesthetics.  
Development took place over the course of one month and involved multiple iterations, refinements, and improvements before reaching the final version.  
AI-assisted tools such as GitHub Copilot and language models were used to speed up prototyping and explore implementation options, while all final decisions, integrations, and design choices were made manually.
