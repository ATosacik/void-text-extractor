## About

VoidTextExtractor runs entirely locally in your browser, keeping your files private and secure.  
This project was carefully designed and implemented piece by piece by me. I made sure all features work flawlessly, added an interactive title, and even included a hidden credit element.  
The theme, structure, and overall design were crafted entirely by me, putting a lot of thought and love into every detail.  
The project was developed, refined, and finalized over the course of one month, including multiple iterations and improvements.  
AI-assisted tools such as GitHub Copilot and language models were used to speed up prototyping and explore implementation options, but all final decisions, integrations, and design choices were made by me.
